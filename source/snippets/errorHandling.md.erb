A successful error handling strategy requires that your integration recognize the difference between errors that can potentially be resolved by retrying the request and errors that should never be retried automatically. 
The [HTTP status code](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) that is returned with each response is your first indication as to the outcome of the request. Message content is returned as raw text.  You may need to escape it if displayed in HTML.

HTTP<br/>status code | Meaning | To Retry or Not to Retry? |
-----|-----|-----|-----|
2xx | Request was successful.<br/><br/>Example: 200 Success | --
4xx | A problem with request prevented it from executing successfully.<br/><br/>Examples:<ul><li>400 Bad Request</li><li>401 Not Authorized</li><li>403 Forbidden</li><li>404 Not Found</li><li>405 Method Not Supported</li><li>406 Not Acceptable</li><li>415 Unsupported Media Type</li><li>429 Too Many Requests</li></ul> | Never <i>automatically</i> retry the request.<br/><br/>If the error code indicates a problem that can be fixed, fix the problem and then retry the request.<br/><br/>See [Error Handling](#error-handling) for error handling recommendations by error code.
5xx | The request was properly formatted, but the operation failed on Smartsheet's end.<br/><br/>Examples:<ul><li>500 Internal Server Error</li><li>503 Service Unavailable</li></ul> | In some scenarios, requests should be automatically retried using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff" target="_blank">exponential backoff</a>.<br/><br/>In other cases, requests should not be retried.<br/><br/>See [Error Handling](#error-handling) for error handling recommendations by error code.

In addition to the HTTP status code, you should also evaluate the Smartsheet-specific error code thatâ€™s returned in the response body for any unsuccessful request. 
All errors will also be accompanied by JSON-formatted error objects, containing a Smartsheet-specific error code and a descriptive message. 
For example, doing a `GET` on a non-existent sheet at `https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456` will result in an HTTP status code of **404**, indicating the resource was not found. 
The body of the response will include an Error object:

{<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"errorCode": 1006,<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"message": "Not Found"<br/>
}

Some errors may contain a **detail** attribute set to an object with additional error details that may be useful in programmatically handling the error.  If so, it will be noted in the specific API operation for which the error may occur.

See [Error Handling](#error-handling) for detailed error handling recommendations.
